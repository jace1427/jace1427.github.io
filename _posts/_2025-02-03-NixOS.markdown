# A Linux Story </3

My fear of Linux had stemmed from my time in university, trying to get WSL working.
We were told that we needed to use an Unbuntu VM in order to code in C (I'll leave that debate as an exercise to the reader).
So when _No Boilerplate_ said I could have my cake and eat it too, I was sold.
The idea of built in roll backs, the best of bleeding edge and stability, and a large community seemed incredible!
But the truth is, NixOS is flawed, I'd argue it's fundamentally flawed.
