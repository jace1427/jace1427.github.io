Below you'll find some information about my experience at Microsoft, and BizzWithBuzz. I've also included some bits about my favorite projects.

## Work Experience

### Microsoft

- **Data Oriented Development**: Enhanced telemetry using Azure Monitor, and through the development of Kusto logs and dashboards. Used new data to make priority decisions.

- **Incident Detection and Resolution**: Performed many on-call shifts. Detected incidents with Kusto and SQL. Ensured SLA by mitigating and resolving high-priority incidents with internal tooling. Wrote postmortems and implemented permanent bug fixes with C#.

- **Performance Testing Suite**: Developed an autonomous performance testing suite in C# to measure and record service performance in RPS. Integrated with existing CI/CD pipelines to ensure future builds don't regress.

- **Security Improvements**: Discovered vulnerabilities through experimentation and reproduction of external tips. Implemented critical security fixes for the service with C#.

- **Service Upgrades Coordination**: Coordinated and executed internal and external service upgrades with internal deployment tools. Planned updates up to a year in advance with monthly and quarterly releases.

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Achieved complete coverage by creating end-to-end and unit tests in C#. Set the organizational standard for testing.

- **Feature Design and Implementation**: Spearheaded the design of multiple user facing features in C#. Collaborated with other teams to ensure alignment with user needs and timely delivery.

### BizzWithBuzz

- **User Interface Design**: Created user friendly and visually appealing UI's for customers.

- **Cloud Management**: Managed and deployed websites to AWS, ensured optimal performance, security, and up-time.

- **Collaboration and Problem-Solving**: Worked with team members to troubleshoot and improve website functionality.

## Projects

- Designed a custom library to interface with the QMC5883L Compass on Pico microcontrollers.

- Developed functionality for calibration to ensure accurate magnetic field and azimuth readings.

- Focused on creating a user-friendly API with comprehensive documentation for ease of use.

### [P2P](https://github.com/jace1427/p2p)

- Produced a peer-to-peer web based messaging system with Flask.

- Engineered with the Python Cryptography library to be fully encrypted, and password protected.

- Created local data storage with SQLite3.

### [Camera Calculator](https://github.com/jace1427/CameraCalculator)

- Designed and developed a web application using React and Python capable of parsing pictures of handwritten equations, and returning a solution.

- Implemented a neural network in python to recognize mathematical equations via camera input.

- Developed a Lexical parser in Python to parse input provided by the neural network.

### [Fast Fourier Transforms](https://github.com/jace1427/Fast_Fourier_Transforms)

- Developed a library containing multi-threaded discrete Fourier Transforms functions in C++.

- Implemented functionality to extract specific musical pitches from WAV files using the discrete Fourier Transforms.

- Designed a testing suite to compare Fourier Transform algorithms, and find the best approach to multi-threading them.

### [SnakeAI](https://github.com/jace1427/SnakeAI)

- Built a generational neural network from scratch in Python to play the classic game Snake autonomously.

- Leveraged reinforcement learning principles to train the AI agent on game strategies, improving performance through generations.

- Managed neural network structure, game logic, and matrix computations to enhance decision-making and adaptability over time.
