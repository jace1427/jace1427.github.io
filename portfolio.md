Below you'll find some information about my experience at Microsoft, and BizzWithBuzz. I've also included some bits about my favorite projects.

## Microsoft

_Data Oriented Development_: Enhanced telemetry using Azure Monitor, and through the development of Kusto logs and dashboards. Used new data to make priority decisions.
_Incident Detection and Resolution_: Performed many on-call shifts. Detected incidents with Kusto and SQL. Ensured SLA by mitigating and resolving high-priority incidents with internal tooling. Wrote postmortems and implemented permanent bug fixes with C#.
_Performance Testing Suite_: Developed an autonomous performance testing suite in C# to measure and record service performance in RPS. Integrated with existing CI/CD pipelines to ensure future builds don't regress.
_Security Improvements_: Discovered vulnerabilities through experimentation and reproduction of external tips. Implemented critical security fixes for the service with C#.
_Service Upgrades Coordination_: Coordinated and executed internal and external service upgrades with internal deployment tools. Planned updates up to a year in advance with monthly and quarterly releases.
_Comprehensive Testing_: Achieved complete coverage by creating end-to-end and unit tests in C#. Set the organizational standard for testing.
_Feature Design and Implementation_: Spearheaded the design of multiple user facing features in C#. Collaborated with other teams to ensure alignment with user needs and timely delivery.

## BizzWithBuzz

_User Interface Design_: Created user friendly and visually appealing UI's for customers.
_Cloud Management_: Managed and deployed websites to AWS, ensured optimal performance, security, and up-time.
_Collaboration and Problem-Solving_: Worked with team members to troubleshoot and improve website functionality.

## QMC5883L

Designed a custom library to interface with the QMC5883L Compass on Pico microcontrollers.
Developed functionality for calibration to ensure accurate magnetic field and azimuth readings.
Focused on creating a user-friendly API with comprehensive documentation for ease of use.

## P2P

Produced a peer-to-peer web based messaging system with Flask.
Engineered with the Python Cryptography library to be fully encrypted, and password protected.
Created local data storage with SQLite3.

## Camera Calculator

Designed and developed a web application using React and Python capable of parsing pictures of handwritten equations, and returning a solution.
Implemented a neural network in python to recognize mathematical equations via camera input.
Developed a Lexical parser in Python to parse input provided by the neural network.

## Fast Fourier Transforms

Developed a library containing multi-threaded discrete Fourier Transforms functions in C++.
Implemented functionality to extract specific musical pitches from WAV files using the discrete Fourier Transforms.
Designed a testing suite to compare Fourier Transform algorithms, and find the best approach to multi-threading them.

## SnakeAI

Built a generational neural network from scratch in Python to play the classic game Snake autonomously.
Leveraged reinforcement learning principles to train the AI agent on game strategies, improving performance through generations.
Managed neural network structure, game logic, and matrix computations to enhance decision-making and adaptability over time.
